SQL Codes- Intro

**What is SQL?
**SQL stands for Structured Query Language
**SQL lets you access and manipulate databases
**SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987

*** To select all the columns from the table '*' is used to select from a table named 'Customer'

SELECT * FROM Customers; 

**SELECT column1, column2, ...
**FROM table_name;



***SQL keywords in upper-case.

**Semicolon after SQL Statements?
**Some database systems require a semicolon at the end of each SQL statement.
**Semicolon is the standard way to separate each SQL statement in database systems that allow more than one SQL statement to be executed in the same call to the server.
**We will use semicolon at the end of each SQL statement.
